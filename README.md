# Steam price checker

You can insert to this script your game appID which you want to watch. This will notify you when the game is on discount (if the user wants this option) or when the game is at or under the target price (which the user can define).

The refresh time is 1 hour, but you can change it in the script in the last line.

All price is in USD

Script was written in python3
