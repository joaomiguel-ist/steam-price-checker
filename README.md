# Steam price checker

You can insert to this script your game appID which you want to watch. This will notify you when the game is on discount (if the user wants this option) or when the game is at or under the target price (which the user can define).

The refresh time is 1 hour, but can be changed in the script on the last line.

## How to

1. Get your steam game appIDs

3. Insert the appIDs
4. Choose your target price (If you don't want this, just type a low number like 1)
5. Decide if you want to get alert when the game is on a discount (discount percent > 0)
6. Minimize and wait
